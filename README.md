# Mastermind-game
The object of MASTERMIND (r) is to guess a secret code consisting of a series of 4
colored pegs. Each guest results in feedback narrowing down the possibilities of the
code. The winner is the player who solves his opponent's secret code with fewer
guesses.
The basic premise of the game is that the problem setter picks a combination of four coloured pegs (usually from a choice of white, black, red, yellow, green, blue) and hides them. The guesser then has to guess the exact sequence. They give a series of guesses, to which the setter replies with how many are the right colour in the right place (denoted by a black peg), and how many are the right colour in the wrong place (a white peg). By a process of deduction the guesser can eventually figure out what the combination is.
